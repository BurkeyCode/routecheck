# routecheck - check the route to a destination and report which of the specified routes were encountered.

	This was designed to check for which gateway is active in a redundantly linked environment.

	This is a functional example of the Windows IcmpSendEcho functions to trace a route, you are free to do with it as you like!
  Hopefully it helps someone or you can learn something, as I did while creating it.
